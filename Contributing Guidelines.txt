# How to contribute

We appreciate that you are reading this, because we need volunteer developers, students, and researchers to help build upon this project for the future of space applications.

## Submitting changes

We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions and make sure all of your commits are defined one at a time.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

Thanks,
Marc Alania, Mohammed Almozahmi, William "Chase" McPherson, Muhannad Alsulaiman, and Zoe Wilderspin
